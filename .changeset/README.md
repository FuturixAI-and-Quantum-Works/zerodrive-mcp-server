# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).

## How to use

When you make changes that need to be released:

1. Run `bun changeset` (or `npm run changeset`)
2. Select the type of change (patch, minor, major)
3. Write a summary of your changes
4. Commit the generated changeset file with your PR

On merge to main, the CI will:
1. Create a "Version Packages" PR that bumps versions
2. When that PR is merged, publish to npm
